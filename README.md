# wifidrivers

Wifi drivers for : TP-Link AC600 Archer T2U Plus [ rtl8812au ]

Some fixes - 

1) Ubuntu not waking up after second suspend [ or any debian based distro in this case, even linux mint had this issue and i sadly removed that, thinking it was internal fault, but rather it's gpu driver issue ]
   
2) Removing firefox and thunderbird entirely
