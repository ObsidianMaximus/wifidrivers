The suspend option in debian doesn't really suspend it. Rather it makes the display get no input while keeping the system on.

Led lights work on cabinet and keyboard + mouse, but screen is blank and only monitor bottom light blinks.

This is the solution for amd drivers - 

Installing `amdgpu-install` and installing the AMD graphic cards components[1] after checking the secure boot support[2]:
```
amdgpu-install --usecase=graphics
