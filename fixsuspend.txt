The suspend option in debian doesn't really suspend it. Rather it makes the display get no input while keeping the system on.

Led lights work on cabinet and keyboard + mouse, but screen is blank and only monitor bottom light blinks.


Installing `amdgpu-install` and installing the AMD graphic cards components[1] after checking the secure boot support[2]:
```
amdgpu-install --usecase=graphics

This is the solution for amd drivers - 

First enable secure boot through BIOS [ for debian based distributions ]
To do that, go to BIOS, enable secure boot, change its type to custom and restore factory keys, then reboot. Then set the option to standard and save settings. Secure boot is now on.
NOTE : This can lead to wifi drivers to fail, so reinstall wifi-drivers, this time with invoking MOK Manager.

Now go to https://www.amd.com/en/support/graphics/ and download the drivers for your device. 
Then do - 
$ sudo apt-get update
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ sudo apt-get install ./amdgpu-install-VERSION.deb
$ sudo apt-get update
$ amdgpu-install --usecase=graphics

And then its done.
